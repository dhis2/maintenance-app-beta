# Url path structure

We've agreed on the following structure:

```
/categories
/categories?bulkEdit=true
/categories/:id
```

* We agreed to omit the `/list` and `/edit` prefixes and go for a more standard
  approach
* Bulk editing will be integrated in the list view, so we wonâ€™t need a new
  page/route for this.
