# Client-side state

This topic is still open for discussion.
The next steps we want to take is to sketch out the potential client-side state
so we have a better understanding of what a state-management library must be
capable of.

Current candidates are:

* Redux - Better for complex use-cases and debugging
* Zustand - Simpler setup and usage
